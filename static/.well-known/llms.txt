## Overview

- **Entities**: Represent primary nodes in the knowledge graph, each with:
  - **Name**: Unique identifier.
  - **Entity Type**: Classification (e.g., "person", "organization").
  - **Observations**: List of factual statements about the entity.

  *Example*:
  ```json
  {

    "to": "Anthropic",
    "relationType": "works_at"
  }
  ```

- **Observations**: Discrete pieces of information about an entity, stored as strings and attached to specific entities. They should be atomic, representing a single fact per observation.
